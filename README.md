# Krosbox

## How to use

- Clone or download this repo.
- Move *each file* (not the whole folders) from `client\` to your game folder, preserving the relative paths.
  - Replacing `mono.dll` is optional, but it is required if you want to be able to debug the client.
- Edit `serverdefault.xml` to configure your environment (mainly the IP address).
- Launch the game with `run.bat`. Alternatively, you can launch it from the command line if you need to redirect output or whatever, the key thing is to launch it with the `-S` option.

Server section is WIP.
